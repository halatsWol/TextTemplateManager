## Text Template Manager {{VERSION}}

A hotkey-driven text-template paste tool for Windows — organize reusable snippets in folders,
give them shortcuts, and paste them into any application from a global Quick Paste window.

### Install

Download **`TextTemplateManager-Setup-{{VERSION}}.exe`** from the assets below and run it.

- Per-user install — no administrator rights required.
- Self-contained — the .NET 8 runtime and the Windows App SDK are bundled, so nothing else needs to be installed. The bundled runtime is always the latest .NET 8 release available at the time this version was built.

Already have it installed? The app offers this update automatically, or you can trigger it from **Help ▸ Check for Updates**.

> **Note — update size:** Some updates download more than usual because they include a refreshed bundled .NET runtime, which is delivered in full for reliability. These runtime refreshes aren't listed separately in the notes, so an occasionally larger update is expected.

> **Note — Remote Desktop (RDP):** If Text Template Manager runs on both your local computer and a remote computer you connect to over RDP, the global Quick Paste hotkey always opens Quick Paste on the **local** computer — Windows delivers a registered global hotkey locally, so it never reaches the remote session. Give each machine a **different** Quick Paste hotkey, or run only one instance, to avoid the clash.

### What's new in this release

#### New & improved

- **Notifications can be turned off.** A new **Notifications** section in **Settings ▸ General** with **Show update notifications** (on by default). With it off, updates are only shown inside the app — everything else, including automatic installing, carries on as before.
- **Simpler asset names on the Releases page.** The manuals and the cleanup tool no longer carry the version in their file names, so a saved link to them keeps working from one release to the next. The cleanup tool is now **`TextTemplateManager-Support-Cleanup.exe`**.

#### Fixes

- Much older versions could be offered the wrong download when checking for updates. Release files are listed alphabetically, which put the bundled cleanup tool ahead of the installer, so a version predating 1.2 could pick that up instead. The installer is now identified by name rather than by position. Nothing was installed without asking — the tool always prompts before it does anything — but it was a confusing thing to be handed.
