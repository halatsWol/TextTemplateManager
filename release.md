## Text Template Manager {{VERSION}}

A hotkey-driven text-template paste tool for Windows — organize reusable snippets in folders,
give them shortcuts, and paste them into any application from a global Quick Paste window.

### Install

Download **`TextTemplateManager-Setup-{{VERSION}}.exe`** from the assets below and run it.

- Per-user install — no administrator rights required.
- Self-contained — the .NET 8 runtime and the Windows App SDK are bundled, so nothing else needs to be installed. The bundled runtime is always the latest .NET 8 release available at the time this version was built.

Already have it installed? The app offers this update automatically, or you can trigger it from **Help ▸ Check for Updates**.

> **Note — update size:** Some updates download more than usual because they include a refreshed bundled .NET runtime, which is delivered in full for reliability. These runtime refreshes aren't listed separately in the notes, so an occasionally larger update is expected.

> **Note — Remote Desktop (RDP):** If Text Template Manager runs on both your local computer and a remote computer you connect to over RDP, the global Quick Paste hotkey always opens Quick Paste on the **local** computer — Windows delivers a registered global hotkey locally, so it never reaches the remote session. Give each machine a **different** Quick Paste hotkey, or run only one instance, to avoid the clash.

### What's new in this release

#### New & improved

- **The Multi Key list is usable without holding Alt.** Switching to the **Multi Key** tab now highlights its first row, and **↑ / ↓** and **Enter** work there just as they do on the **Single Key** tab. Previously that tab opened with nothing selected and responded only while **Alt** was held.
- **Arrow keys wrap around the shortcut lists.** Pressing **↓** on the last row returns to the first, and **↑** on the first row jumps to the last, instead of stopping at the ends. Applies to both tabs.
